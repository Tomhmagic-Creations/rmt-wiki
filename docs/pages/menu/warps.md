# Warps

Warps are similar to Homes, however, they are set by Admins and are public. They can be used for any range of reasons, such as public areas like Nether portals, farms, or event areas, etc. Once a Warp has been added by and Admin, they will be listed in the Warp section of the RMT menu. Once clicking a Warp, you will teleport there after the cooldown.
