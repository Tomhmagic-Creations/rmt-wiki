# 🌐 Warps

Warps function similarly to Homes but are set by Admins and are publicly accessible. They are ideal for directing players to key locations such as:

- Public Nether portals
- Farms
- Event areas
- Shops

---

## 🛠️ Setting Warps

- Admins can create Warps through the RMT menu.
- Warps will be listed in the Warp section of the RMT menu once set.
- Players can click a Warp to teleport there after the cooldown period.

---

## 🎯 Rank-Specific Warps

- Admins can restrict Warps to specific ranks.
- If a player does not have the required rank, the Warp will not be visible in the Warp menu.
