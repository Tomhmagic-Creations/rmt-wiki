# Homes
Home allows you to set a location you wish to teleport to in the future. You are able to set the location you are standing and give it a unique name to help you remember what location it is. This could be a spawner you want to go back to or use to turn into a grinder or a biome with resources that you want to be able to go back to collect or for any reason you would want to set. You are only allowed <span style="color: green;">**5**</span> homes.

The Homes section also allows you to TP back to your bed location if you have placed a bed and are in The Overworld, or a Respawn Anchor location if you have activated one and are in The Nether.
