# 🏠 Homes

Homes allow you to set specific locations that you can teleport back to later. You can name each home to easily remember its purpose, such as a spawner, resource-rich biome, or base.

* You can set up to <span style="color: green;">**5**</span> homes.
* Each home is saved with a unique name for easy identification.

* **Bed Location:** Available if you have placed a bed and are in The Overworld.
* **Respawn Anchor:** Available if you have activated a Respawn Anchor and are in The Nether.
