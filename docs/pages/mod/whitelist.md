# Whitelist
This allows moderators to add and remove players from the whitelist. If admins have turned on the whitelist, this will only allow the players (plus admins and mods) on the whitelist to join the Server.

On clicking the button, this will show the Manage Whitlist menu. There is a button to add players to the whitelist. Clicking this will give you an input form to input the players' GameTag; make sure you enter this correctly.  If there are players on the whitelist, a remove player button will also show on the menu. Clicking this will show a menu with all the whitelist players as a button. Clicking a player on the remove player menu will remove that player's name from the whitelist.
