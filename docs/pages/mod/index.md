# General Options

Here are some of the general option from the Moderation menu that doesn't require their own pages. Find information of the other features for their dedicated pages on the sidebar.

## Teleport to Player

This button allows you to teleport to a player chosen from the online list. Similar to TPA, however, there is no need for the other player to accept the teleport or any teleport cooldown.

## Teleport Player to You

This button allows you to teleport a player chosen from the online list to you. Similar to the TPHERE, however, there is no need for the other player to accept the teleport or any teleport cooldown.
