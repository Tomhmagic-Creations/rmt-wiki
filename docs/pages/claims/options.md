# Claim Options
Claim options are particular options you can toggle on a claim/subclaim. The current options are:

**Monster Spawn** - Allows monsters to spawn. Default True

**Explosion** - Allows blocks to break on explosion. Default False

**Entity Damage** - Prevents damage from entities

**Player Damage** - Prevents damage from players

::: info Note
Entity and Player damage can still be caused, but the value is reset as there is no method to cancel. Both Options will not prevent death if the damage is too high.
