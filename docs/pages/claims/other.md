# 🛡️ Other Claim Features

Claims come with additional management options accessible in the RMT Manage Claims menu:

---

### 📝 Rename Claims

- You can name or rename your main dimension claims to better organize them.
- This can be done individually for each dimension (Overworld, Nether, End).

---

### ❌ Removing Chunks

- You can remove specific chunks from a claim.
- Removal must start from the outer edges to prevent creating ring claims.

---

### 🗑️ Deleting a Claim

- You can delete the entire claim for a specific dimension.
- This action will also delete all associated subclaim data for that dimension.
