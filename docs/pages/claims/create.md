# 🛡️ Create a Claim

To create a new claim, place a Claim Flag in the desired area. Ensure you are at least <span style="color: green;">**10**</span> chunks away from another claim to prevent surrounding or boxing in other players. The Claim Flag will stay for a few seconds, displaying particles to indicate the newly claimed area.

Once a claim is created, it will appear in the RMT menu, allowing you to manage it further.

### 📏 Expanding a Claim

You can expand a claim by placing another Claim Flag:

- **Adjacent:** Place a flag next to existing claim chunks to expand.
- **Separate Group:** Place a flag over <span style="color: green;">**10**</span> chunks away from any current claims to start a new group of chunks within the same dimension. These groups will still adhere to the main claim settings unless assigned to a subclaim.
