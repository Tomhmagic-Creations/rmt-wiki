# 🛡️ Trusted Players and Ranks

Grant specific players or ranks access to perform actions within your claims or subclaims. This can be managed via the RMT Manage Claim or Edit Subclaim menus.

---

## 👥 Trusted Players

* Add specific players to your Trusted Players list for claims or subclaims.
* Choose from current online players or from the list of all players.
* Trusted Players can perform actions defined under the "Trusted" permission level.

---

## 🏆 Trusted Ranks

* Similar to Trusted Players, but applied to player ranks.
* Adding a Trusted Rank allows anyone with that rank to pass permission checks if the permission is set to "Ranks" or "Player & Ranks".
* Recommended for Admin claims as rank-based permissions apply to all players holding that rank.

::: warning
Only add players and ranks you fully trust to avoid griefing or theft within your claims.
