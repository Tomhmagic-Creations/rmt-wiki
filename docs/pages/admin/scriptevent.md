# Custom Scriptevents

So there are a couple custom scriptevent commands that have been added to allow you to interact with the Add-On and edit data.

## Editing Claim Blocks
- Use the command `/scriptevent thm_rmt:editClaimBlocks [value]`
- This command must be executed targeting the player whose claim blocks you want to edit, for example `/execute as @a at @s run scriptevent thm_rmt:editClaimBlocks [value]`
- Use a positive value to add claim blocks or a negative value to remove claim blocks from the player.

## Resetting Holograms
- Use the command `/scriptevent thm_rmt:resetPlacedHolograms [player name]`
- This will reset the hologram count for the specified player allowing them to place more
