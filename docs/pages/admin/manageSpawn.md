# 🛠️ Manage Spawn

The Manage Spawn menu allows Admins to set and manage various spawn points for the world or realm, including default, custom, and first spawn locations.

---

## 🌍 Set Default Spawn

* Sets the **vanilla world default spawn** to your current location.

---

## 🎯 Set Custom Spawn

* Sets a **custom spawn point** based on your current location, rotation, and head rotation.
* The custom spawn is used for the RMT Spawn button. If no custom spawn is set, the default spawn is used.

---

## 🚀 Set First Spawn

* Sets a custom **first spawn point** for new players, based on your current location, rotation, and head rotation.

---

## ❌ Delete Spawn Points

* If a Custom or First Spawn has been set, options to **delete these spawns** will appear at the bottom of the menu.
