# Manage Spawn

This menu allows you to manage all the different types of spawn for the world or realm.

## Set Default Spawn
Clicking this will set the vanilla world default spawn to your location.

## Set Custom Spawn
Clicking this will set a custom spawn at your location, rotation, and head rotation (where you are looking).

The Default and Custom spawns are used for the Spawn button in the RMT menu. If a custom spawn is not set, the default spawn is used.

## Set First Spawn
This option is to set a custom first spawn where new players will spawn. Clicking this will set the spawn at your location, rotation, and head rotation (where you are looking).

If you have a Custom and/or First Spawn, then buttons for each will appear at the bottom to delete; clicking these buttons will delete the selected spawn.
