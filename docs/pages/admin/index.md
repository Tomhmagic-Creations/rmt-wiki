# ⚙️ Systems

The RMT Add-On includes several background systems that operate independently of the menu or items. These systems enhance gameplay and server management.

---

## 🛠️ Admin Setup

- To access all admin features upon loading the Add-On, you need to grant yourself the `op` tag.
- Use the command: `/tag @s add op`
- This is necessary as the Add-On cannot currently check for OP status directly.

---

## 🛡️ Anti-Xray

- The Add-On includes an anti-xray system that prevents common Bedrock x-ray methods.
- This system has no impact on server performance and is handled entirely through the client pack.

---

## 💤 AFK System

- The AFK system automatically detects idle players to prevent playtime farming or AFK claim chunk rewards.
- Settings can be adjusted to:

 - Set the duration before a player is marked as AFK.
 - Include or exclude Mods from the AFK system.
 - Prevent monster spawns around AFK players to avoid AFK mob farming.
 - Kick players after a set AFK duration (Admins are never kicked; Mods can be exempted).
