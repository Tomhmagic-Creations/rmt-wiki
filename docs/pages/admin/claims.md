# 🏴 Admin Claims

Admin Claims allow administrators to claim chunks without the usual restrictions applied to player claims. These claims are managed similarly to normal claims but provide additional control and flexibility.

## 🎯 Give Admin Claim Flag

* This option grants you an **Admin Claim Flag**, which functions similarly to the standard Claim Flag but is specifically for Admin Claims.
* The Admin Claim Flag will **despawn if dropped** and can only be used by Admins.

* Admin Claims are treated like player claims but without chunk limits or proximity restrictions.
* Admins can claim unlimited chunks in all dimensions and can claim near other player claims without restrictions.
