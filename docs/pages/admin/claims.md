# Admin Claims

## Give Admin Claim Flag
This option gives you an Admin Claim Flag. This item is used similarly to the normal claim flag to create Admin Claims. The Admin Claim Flag will despawn if dropped and can only be used by Admins.

## Manage Admin Claim
This option allows you to manage the admin claims and only appears once you have started an admin claim. Admin claims are created as if it were a player without a claim chunk limit or claim radius protection. This means you can claim as many chunks in all dimensions, and there is no prevention for being too close to another claim.

Admin claims are managed exactly like normal claims. The menu is the same with all the same features.
