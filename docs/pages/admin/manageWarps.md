# Manage Warps

This section allows you to add and edit custom warps accessible to players in the Warps menu of the RMT.

## Add Warp
On selecting Add Warp, you will be asked to set a warp name. On submitting, this will create the warp at your location, rotation, and head rotation (where you are looking).

## Edit Warp
When warps have been created, in the Manage Warps menu, each warp will have its own “Edit WARPNAME” button. The edit section allows you to change the name, add a description, set a new location, or delete the warp.
