# 🏆 Manage Ranks

The Manage Ranks section allows Admins to add, edit, and remove custom ranks. Ranks are primarily cosmetic and are displayed next to a player's name. Admin and Moderator ranks are reserved for admin/mod features and cannot be deleted.

## ➕ Add/Edit Ranks

When adding or editing a rank, you will be presented with input settings to configure the rank. Admin and Moderator ranks can only have their color and priority edited.

### ⚙️ Rank Settings:

- **Rank Name:** The display name of the rank (no spaces, must be unique).
- **Priority:** A unique number to determine rank display order. Higher priority ranks will override lower ones.
- **Rank Colour:** The color displayed next to the player's name.
- **Give Type:** How the rank is assigned:
 - **Manual:** Assigned manually through the Manage Players menu.
 - **Playtime:** Assigned when a player reaches a set playtime in seconds.
 - **Player Kills:** Assigned based on player kills.
 - **Monster Kills:** Assigned based on monster kills.
 - **Deaths:** Assigned based on death count.
 - **Scoreboard:** Assigned based on a specific scoreboard value.
- **Give Value:** The target value for non-manual ranks (e.g., playtime seconds, kills).
- **Scoreboard:** The name of the scoreboard objective if using the scoreboard give type.
