# Manage Ranks

This section allows you to add, edit, and remove custom ranks. Ranks are currently a cosmetic feature that is displayed next to a player's name. Other than Admin and Moderator ranks, these are reserved for the Admin and Mod features.

## Add/Edit Ranks
When clicking on Add Rank or Edit RANKNAME, you will see an input form to add/edit the values of the new or existing rank. Admin and Moderator ranks cannot be deleted, and you can only edit the colour and priority in the Manage Rank menu. However, you can change the display name in the Settings.

Here are the input settings for Adding/Editing Ranks:

- **Rank Name**: This is the display name of the rank and will also be stored (without spaces) as its ID. This must be unique.
- **Priority**: This is a unique number to give the system a way to prioritise ranks in the name display; the rank with the highest priority will be the rank shown next to the player's name. No ranks can share the same priority. The priority of Admin and Mod ranks doesn’t have to be the highest and won’t affect their permissions.
- **Rank Colour**: This is the colour of the rank when displayed next to a player's nametag.
- **Give Type**: Ranks can be given in different ways:
    - **Manual**: This is given manually by admins through the Manage Players section.
    - **Playtime**: This is given automatically when a player reaches the given amount of playtime in seconds.
    - **Player Kills**: This is given automatically when a player reaches the given amount of player kills.
    - **Monster Kills**: This is given automatically when a player reaches a given amount of monster kills.
    - **Deaths**: This is given automatically when a player reaches a given amount of deaths.
    - **Scoreboard**: This is given automatically when a player reaches the given amount for the given scoreboard.
- **Give Value**: If the give type is not manual, this will be the value needed to give the rank for player/monster kills, playtime, deaths, and score.
- **Scoreboard**: If using the give type of scoreboard, this will be the name of the scoreboard objective.

## Delete Ranks
All ranks other than Admin and Moderator can be deleted.
