# Trusted Players

To allow players to access your claim, build, break or whatever you want them to be able to do. You must first add them to the trusted players list, either in the main claim or subclaim/s. 
This can be done in the RMT Manage Claim or Edit Sub Claim menus. You can choose from current online players or from the list of all players. Once a player is trusted, they are able to the actions that are set under the permissions as “Trusted”.

::: warning
Only add players to your trust and pemissions that you trust not to break your builds or steal your items.
