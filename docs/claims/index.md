# Claims

Claims are a way to protect land, buildings, chests, and anything else inside of them. Claims are a set of permissions, options and trusted members associated with that dimensions’ “claim”. Unless otherwise set by admins, each player can create one claim in each of the three Minecraft dimensions (Overworld, The Nether and The End). If you do not own any claims, the Manage Claim section in the RMT menu will not show.

### What exacly is a claim?
Let's look at the Overworld. If we create a "Claim" this will be our "Overworld Claim", any chunks we add to this claim will all follow the the permissions and options of this claim. Regardless if all the chunks are together of spread a part, they all come under the "Overworld Claim".

# Subclaims
Subclaims are a way to assign a group of chunks (not necessarily together) their own set of permissions, trusted players and options. Subclaim chunks do not need to be next to each other, but subclaims are limited to their main claims dimension. 

You can create sub-claims in the RMT menu under Manage Claims. You give your subclaim a unique name, and you can assign claim chunks to it. Claim chunks can only be assigned to one subclaim at a time; subclaim permissions, trusted players, and options override the main claim. Subclaims are a good way to give other players their own area within your claim to build and play in, without having to give them access to everything.

### Claim Visualisation



::: details Overworld Claim Example
<img src="/assets/images/claims/claim.png" alt="claims" style="width:500px;"/>
If we look at the above image, here are 8 Claim Chunks claimed in the Overworld. They are no joined together but they will all use the same core permissions, options and trusted players.

::: details Overworld Subclaim Example
<img src="/assets/images/claims/subclaim.png" alt="claims" style="width:500px;"/>
Here we have the same Overworld claim, however 2 Claim Chunks have been marked in red, these are added to one Subclaim Group, these 2 claims, dispite being apart will follow their Subclaim permissions, options and trusted players.
